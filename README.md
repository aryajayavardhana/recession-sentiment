Title: Sentiment Analysis of Recession in Indonesia - Dataset Imbalance Handling

### Overview

This repository addresses the challenge of imbalanced datasets in sentiment analysis pertaining to the economic recession in Indonesia. As a research assistant, I tackled this issue by employing advanced oversampling techniques, specifically SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) and RandomOversampler. The ultimate goal was to enhance the predictive accuracy of sentiment analysis models and contribute valuable insights into the public sentiment during economic downturns.

### Key Features

## - Imbalance Mitigation Techniques:
1. Utilized SMOTE and RandomOversampler to address the class imbalance inherent in sentiment analysis datasets.
2. Overcame challenges associated with skewed data distribution, ensuring a more robust and representative dataset.

## - Predictive Modeling:
1. Implemented a sentiment analysis predictive model using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm.
2. Leveraged SVM for its efficacy in handling high-dimensional data and its capacity to discern complex patterns within the imbalanced dataset.
